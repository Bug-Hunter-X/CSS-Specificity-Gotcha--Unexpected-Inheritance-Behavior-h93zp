The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This will not override the color of the <p> element */
}
```

The issue lies in the specificity of the CSS rules. While `div p` targets `<p>` elements within `<div>` elements, the more specific rule `p { color: red; }` takes precedence, causing the text to remain red, not green.  This is unexpected behavior for developers unfamiliar with CSS specificity nuances.
