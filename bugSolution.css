The solution involves understanding and using CSS specificity correctly.  Here are two approaches:

**1. Using `!important` (generally discouraged):**

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green !important; /* Now this overrides the p selector */
}
```

**2. Increasing Specificity (preferred method):**

Instead of relying on `!important`, create a more specific selector:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

.specific-paragraph {
    color: green;
}

<div>
   <p class="specific-paragraph">This text will be green</p>
</div>
```
By adding a class `.specific-paragraph` to the `<p>` element, we ensure the style applies only to elements with that class, overcoming the default specificity issue.  This is generally a better approach than using `!important`, as `!important` breaks CSS's cascade in an unpredictable manner.
